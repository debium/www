# Christmas Spirit!
I've personally got into the Christmas spirit by completely redeveloping my blog! style.css is so much more Christmas-y, my Gitter chat box is officially a part of the repo, and of course my GitBook has arrived! It's not much; it's just one chapter about the struggles of [pre-git] code sharing, but I will fill it up with details about how I made www, [the new one], and how you can yourself. It will document all kinds of hands on experiences, ranging from forking the Spoon-Knife to implementing Dogecoin in Minecraft. I really hope you like it! It will be hosted in this same repository, viewable [here](ethertyper.gitbooks.io/www/content/)! I really hope you like it, and have a Merry Christmas! [Full details on the Christmas Commit are available under the commits section on GitHub, accessible by the "Fork me on Github" button in the top left corner. Enjoy!
