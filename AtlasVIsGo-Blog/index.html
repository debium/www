    "All is Go." - The words we've all been waiting for.

  <hr />

  <p>This Sunday, on their fourth attempt, NASA officials determined they could send the
  Atlas V safely towards the ISS, and finally launched the Atlas V. In itself, the rocket
  is not very interesting. It's very aerodynamic, and is a result of many years of
  engineering and study, but today, it's not about the Atlas V. It's about it carries,
  the Cygnus Orbital 4.</p>

  <p>The Cygnus contains much awaited resources for the astronauts living on the ISS, the
  last coming as far away as October, as well as several new research projects to test.
  Some of these projects include Astro Pi, NASA's test Hololens devices, a new jetpack
  titled 'SAFER', a life science testing system called 'Space Automated Bioproduct Lab'
  (SABL), and many others.</p>

  <p>I'm most excited about Astro Pi's launch. The 'Astro Pi' is a project by Raspberry
  Pi, endorsing a board primarily just a Raspberry Pi 2 device with a Sense HAT
  connected. It was originally supposed to be a B+, but there was so much delay in
  release of the project, and there were so little compatibility issues that the folks at
  Astro Pi decided to upgrade the system.</p>&nbsp; <img src=

  <p>A Sense HAT is a $35 GPIO connected development board with an integrated sensor of
  gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, separate sensors for temperature and barometric
  pressure, humidity, an 8*8 RGB LED matrix, and a 5-key joystick. So, its an interactive
  multi-sensor that can draw pictures as programmed. Pretty awesome.</p>

  <p>Astro Pi ran an international programming competition. The goal was for grade-school
  children to program what they wanted the Astro Pi project to do at the ISS, and
  hopefully learn something in the process. The seven winners created functional and easy
  programs to run aboard the ISS, with one sensing crew location [Crew Detector], one
  determining what country they were above and showing their flag [Flags], and one
  [SpaceCRAFT] even analyzing the data it finds as a <a href=
  "http://pi.minecraft.net">Minecraft Pi Edition&reg;</a> map.</p>

  <p>Just imagine it; years from now, when the Astro Pi comes back down, we'll be toying
  with subatomic particles on our personal computers, and we'll have to get our old
  Minecraft installation out to play a Minecraft game <strong><em>truly inspired by
  space</em></strong>. Wow... Why can't that be now?</p><img src=

  <p>Hololens has also made a name for themselves. This ambitious augumented reality
  headset has already made itself a future, whether it be the US's own research
  organization's endorsement, or the determination of its parent, Microsoft, in it.</p>

  <p>They are using the Hololens's powerful multi-core processor to analyze data the
  rovers they send to Mars discover, and visualize the data for employees and other
  scientists in general. It's currently, given its price, on the road to become a
  business device, though Microsoft is already paving the path for consumers by porting
  some of its major games and apps to Hololens, e.g. Minecraft, and Xbox. I wonder if Tim
  peake will use Minecraft Windows 10 Edition Beta on the Hololens to view the SpaceCRAFT
  map I was talking about earlier... Sorry, off topic!</p>

  <p>Another exciting news point is a new set of tutorials to get on the blockchain that
  has taken the world by storm. Ethereum developer, <a href=
  "https://github.com/alexvandesande">Alex Van de Sande</a>, has already begun to review
  and introduce Ethereum's GUI wallet, Mist, in its early betas. The reviews tell you
  about how to use ether, craft tokens, develop democracies and other contracting
  devices, execute functions from bytecode, and even host a bank. These tutorials are
  part of an movement for not only private blockchains, but personal and customizable
  blockchains. It illustrates how the blockchain can be used for actual business and fun
  purposes through common applications. And all of this, in less than an Hour of
  Code.</p>

  <p>These reviews are made easy by the (in-development) GUI-based tools: the geth based
  <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/mist">Mist browser</a> (to be 1.0 in Metropolis),
  and the eth based <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/alethzero">AlethOne</a> (already
  out of beta). Also, an eth-based IDE, <a href=
  "https://github.com/ethereum/mix">Mix</a>, is already in development if you want to
  check it out.</p>

  <p>Anyways, that's about it on Eli's Web Log of Webbiness for today. Sorry about the
  HTML frustration, I think I'll be able to make it as the WordPress format this coming
  week. But regardless of format, I'll see you next time!</p>
