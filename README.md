#Where can I check out this wonderful repo in action? Surely, I don't have to clone it?
You can check it out [Here](https://github.ethertyper.com)! However, if you need it on the go, you'd better clone it. Consider it as if the "gh-pages" branch was instead named "develop".
#Changes to site? Suggestions?
Just click the button in the top right are labeled "Fork", make your changes, implement your ideas, and give me a pull request. Piece of cake. Please be aware that your changes are MIT License if you commit them to this repo.

# About the GitBook.
My GitBook, AKA www, is also hosted in this repository. It's about my experiences with online tools like git and Bitcoin, how they're causing a revolution, and why you should be a part of it. Its full name will be:
> 'www: A Tale of Adventures in The New Age'

Thanks for waiting so long! The GitBook is finally compiling, but is not yet finished. You can check it out [here](https://ethertyper.gitbooks.io/www/content/)! That is, if you're not reading this from the book already!

# __IMPORTANT NOTICE__
If this notice is still here, you are viewing the _CHRISTMAS COMMIT_. It is specially styled for the season of Jesus's birth, so _PLEASE_ do not use this as a www reference implementation.

That said, much of the changes here are serious changes, to be implemented in future commits. Only some will completely vanish afterwards.

For example, the GitBook will stay, while its cover will change to exclude the Christmas hat. I apologize that only the next commit will appear with a complete www implementation. However, it's Christmas, and I wanted to do something fun. So, enjoy this special Christmas build.

Thanks to my viewers and :octocat: for the understanding attitude,
Eli
