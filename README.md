#Where can I check out this wonderful repo in action? Surely, I don't have to clone it?
You can check it out [Here](https://github.ethertyper.com)! However, if you need it on the go, you'd better clone it. Consider it as if the "gh-pages" branch was instead named "develop".
#Changes to site? Suggestions?
Just click the button in the top right are labeled "Fork", make your changes, implement your ideas, and give me a pull request. Piece of cake. Please be aware that your changes are MIT License if you commit them to this repo.

# About the GitBook.
My GitBook, also called www, is hosted in this repository. It's about my experiences with online tools like git and Bitcoin, how they're causing a revolution, and why you should be a part of it. Its full name will be:
> 'www: A Tale of Adventures in The New Age'

A full copy will be available soon on GitBook, so keep on the look out! But, for now, you can fork the repo and setup a GitBook there, as a form of mirror. The MIT License allows you to do that and read on early. That is, if you're not reading this from the book already!
