# _**CONTRIBUTING**_
Thank you for wanting to contribute to this project! I would like to say a few things about the guidelines for contributing to www. Sadly, we need to keep conformity in your wonderful ideas to an extent. The following rules explain more clearly what is expected over any contribution, from those with official affiliations and the open source community alike.

One of the major points I would like to stress is my _**wish**_ for you not to remove major pieces of software, or any integral to the community's purpose for it. Some examples of replacements may include how the original root page was moved to [/Classic/](http://github.ethertyper.com/Classic/), replaced by the new [root page](http://github.ethertyper.com/).

Another, smaller, request is for all of you to have your commit messages be present tense commands, e.g. "Just screw it", at the same time as having them informative of what patching in your branch will do for the project. A good example would be "Make JSON pie". It tells what it will do in an easy, informative fashion.

One other thing is to please, if combining changes, label the commit "first change/ second change". This combined change message can be substituted for the first if it is a poly-change commit.

And, simply to protect my legal rights, (and my awesomeness), before contributing to this repository, you _**MUST**_ agree to the following Contribution License:

```
Content:
Section I: Rewriting History
Section II: Copyrights
Section III: Contributions
Section IV: Awesomeness

(I) I hereby agree not to rebase commits, revert branches, or otherwise irreversibly "rewrite history" before
pushing to the repository "www.git". (II) I acknowledge Eli Bradley's and other contributors' copyrights to the
project, including that of bots such as the "gitter-badger". (III) I maintain that all contributions to the
repository that I produce, including in the forms of pushes, pull requests, issues, comments, wiki pages, any
self produced content linked via camo.githubusercontent.com, or otherwise any content specifically dedicated to
the repository, as licensed by the MIT License. (IV) Also, Eli is awesome.
```

And finally, I would like to stress the most important of all of these requirements:
