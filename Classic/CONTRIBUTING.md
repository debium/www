# _**CONTRIBUTING**_
Thank you for wanting to contribute to this project! I would like to say a few things about the guidelines for contributing to www. Sadly, we need to keep conformity in your wonderful ideas to an extent. The following rules explain more clearly what is expected over any contribution, from those with official affiliations and the open source community alike.

Some of the major points I would like to stress is my _**wish**_ for you not to remove major pieces of software, or any integral to the community's purpose for it. Some examples of replacements may include how the original root page was moved to [/Classic/](http://github.ethertyper.com/Classic/), replaced by the new [root page](http://github.ethertyper.com/).
