# Chapter 1: Before

We've all had to suffer through using physical methods of sharing code. Whether it be your genius Snake program, or your [less valuable] MS-DOS source code, we've all lost something because of this.

You, as I have before, may have assumed that digital sharing would've helped. Nope. Digging through thousands of emails, sorting computer chip designs from potato chip designs, and finding differences between versions of codes became everyday monotonous tasks. And we thought it would get easier with this. Because these new technologies proved easy to use, they were seemingly overused.

In this age of extreme confusion, this became a problem. People needed not only automated data sharing, but automated data management to match it. The spam would be dealt with, but what if the changes were important? What if necessaries were deleted? The need for version control became apparent.

Some don't know how to use these tools, thinking of them like AIs beyond their ages. I'm here to dispel that notion, and show just how fun, just how easy it is to work with friends, when something else can manage arguments. How they're deleted and implemented alike is up to you.

I really hope you enjoy this tutorial series! I intend to put a good bit of my day into it every week, so that you can catch up on my technological projects.

Thanks,
Eli

Note: this book wouldn't be possible without :octocat: or the folks at GitBook, so I thank them!
